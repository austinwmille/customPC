            <h2>FAQs</h2>
            <div>
                <h3>Why should I buy a build from you?</h3>
                <p>Because we're transparent and conscientious enough (or, we try our best to be!) not to charge too much for a skill that is not unique to us.</p>
                <p>If you're considering building a PC yourself, we highly recommend it! Building and upgrading a computer is NOT that hard, I promise! Computer parts are much more resilient than they used to be. You got this! Just use pcpartpicker.com and give it a shot. If you run into trouble, send me an email.. I might have time to help ;).</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>How long does it take to build my PC?</h3>
                <p>Once payment is received, the vast majority of builds are completed and shipped within a week. Electronics lose value quickly, so we buy parts individually for each build to get the best deals. Any specials or deals WILL be passed down (you'll see our purchase price on the estimate). We'll keep you updated throughout the process.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Can I request a specific part or brand?</h3>
                <p>Absolutely! Let us know your preferences. Once we review your build, weâ€™ll confirm everything to make sure we understand what you're expecting.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>What payment methods do you accept?</h3>
                <p>Currently, we accept PayPal for security and convenience. They allow small businesses like ours to make and track invoices, and also offer strong consumer protections for yourself!</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>What if I change my mind?</h3>
                <p>If you have submitted a build request, but have not paid yet, then no harm done. You could tell us that in email, or just don't respond to our messages..we'll get the picture.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>But what if I did pay already? Refunds?</h3>
                <p>We start builds as soon as is reasonable! This could be the day of payment, or a couple of days after. Officially we have to say that we DON'T OFFER REFUNDS at this time. But, we're not monsters..if there is any problem that makes you unhappy with our services then please let us know!</p>
