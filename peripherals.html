            <h2>Monitors</h2>
            <p class="product">
                <a href="https://amzn.to/4idumLK">LG 27" UltraGear 4K UHD (3840x2160) Gaming Monitor</a>
                <p>4k, Flat, IPS, $400. Put simply, if you are getting your recommendations from this page, then you don't need a monitor better than this one. Respectable brand; we love it.</p>
            </p>
            <p class="product">
                <a href="https://amzn.to/3B9NgCx">GTEK 240Hz Gaming Monitor</a>
                <p>1080p, Curved, VA Panel, $175. Just a solid monitor with standard features for pretty low cost. If we had to choose one today, this would be on the list of considerations.</p>
            </p>
            <p class="product">
                <a href="https://amzn.to/4iphmmu">Sceptre New 27-inch Gaming Monitor</a>
                <p>1080p, Flat, LCD, $120. There is almost always a Sceptre monitor on our currently recommended list. This is the current cheapest option that we enjoy using, here.</p>

            <h2>Keyboards</h2>
            <p>Personally, we find keyboard recommendations to be very difficult. Just as a prolific writer has their preferred pen, a techie will have their preferred keyboard. That said, below are three GOOD choices that fit a wide range of budgets.</p>
            <p class="product">
                <a href="https://amzn.to/3ZtKuBA">Corsair K70 RGB PRO Wired Mechanical Gaming Keyboard</a>
                <p>RGB, Wired, $170. If you want an RGB keyboard that's been battle-tested, well, we believe that this is the best starting point.</p>
            </p>
            <p class="product">
                <a href="https://amzn.to/3VcKFic">Redragon K668 RGB Gaming Keyboard</a>
                <p>RGB, Wired, $60. We like Redragon here, so this cheap option is sure to last you years.</p>
            </p>
            <p class="product">
                <a href="https://amzn.to/49dZgj0">Logitech G PRO Mechanical Gaming Keyboard</a>
                <p>RGB, Wired, $130. One of the oldest players in the peripheral space, Logitech makes incredibly reliable hardware. This super sleek, compact design is very, very pretty.</p>
